For everyone working on the Food Waste Management Project, welcome!

- Prior to starting, you'll need to have Node.js and Npm installed: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
- You'll then be able clone the repository and `npm install` your dependencies.
- We ask you create a branch before working on a feature.  When you push code into our Github project, push the branch up. You can then make a pull request on Github.  (For information on creating branches and committing, see https://bit.ly/1YLHDLA (you don't need to read "Basic Merging" for Git). For information on making pull requests in Github, see https://bit.ly/2SdyVxl . You can speak with Cory N as well for help, he wants to practice explaining these concepts anyway.)
- For this repository, we have a working list of tasks to complete in the "Projects" tab on this page.  As we center in on what we want to implement, we can break down tasks into smaller pieces and decide who works on which parts.
